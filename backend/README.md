#Getting Started with Flask
This project was created with [Flask].(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

##Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `$ export FLASK_ENV=development`
### `$ flask run`

To enable all development features (including debug mode) you can export the FLASK_ENV environment variable and set it to development before running the server:

This does the following things:

[x]it activates the debugger

[x]it activates the automatic reloader

[x]it enables the debug mode on the Flask application.

In order to check open routes and launch in debug mode you can run:
### `python routes.py`

Both of these run setups can be opened in the browser as [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) to be viewed.

While lightweight and easy to use, Flask’s built-in server is not suitable for production as it doesn’t scale well.
